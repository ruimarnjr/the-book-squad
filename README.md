## UX

The Book Squad is a website focused on people who love reading and enjoy discussing books. As I am one of those people, I wanted to create something that I could understand and feel connected to. The club was created by three friends who are seeking people to share experiences, have a laugh, talk about various topics, and celebrate together.

- As a book enthusiast, I want to browse and discover new book recommendations, so that I can expand my reading list.
- As a member of The Book Squad, I want to participate in book discussions and share my thoughts, so that I can engage with other passionate readers.
- As a user, I want to create a personal reading profile and track the books I've read, so that I can keep a record of my reading journey.
- As a user, I want to receive notifications or updates about upcoming book releases and author events, so that I can stay informed and plan my reading schedule.
- As a book club member, I want to suggest and vote on books for our next reading selection, so that we can collectively decide on our future reads.
- As a user, I want to connect with other book lovers in my local area, so that I can organize or join book-related meetups or events.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Technologies Used

- This website was developed using HTML and CSS.
- I used [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to do the genre boxes in the Let's Meet section.

## Testing 

1. Sign Up form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

- I tested this website in browsers such as Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari and it worked in all of them.

- I tested the page for large, medium and small screen sizes and I confirm that the text is readable and the images display perfectly.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fruimarnjr.github.io%2Fthe-book-squad%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fruimarnjr.github.io%2Fthe-book-squad%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main/Master Branch
  - Once the main/master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found here [The Book Squad](<https://ruimarnjr.github.io/the-book-squad/>)

The Repository can be found here [Repository](https://github.com/ruimarnjr/the-book-squad)

### Forking

- Go to the GitHub repository that you want to fork. This is the repository that you wish to create a personal copy of.
- On the top-right corner of the repository page, you'll find a button labeled "Fork". Click on the "Fork" button to initiate the forking process. This will create a duplicate copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
- GitHub will process the forking request, creating a separate copy of the repository within your account. Once the forking process is complete, you will be redirected to the newly created forked repository.

### Cloning 

- On the GitHub repository page, click on the green "Code" button located towards the top-right of the page. This will display a dropdown menu. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repository's URL to your clipboard.
- Open your preferred terminal or command prompt on your local machine. Ensure you have Git installed and configured properly.
- Use the cd command in the terminal to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone the repository into your "Documents" folder, you would use the command: cd Documents.
- In the terminal, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL you copied in step 1.
- Press Enter to execute the git clone command. Git will connect to the remote repository and download a copy of the entire repository, including all its files, commit history, and branches, to your local machine.
- Once the cloning process is complete, you will see a message indicating that the repository has been successfully cloned to your local machine. You can now navigate to the cloned repository using the terminal.
